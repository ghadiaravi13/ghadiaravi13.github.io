<br>I am a GPU Architect at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/">NVIDIA, Bengaluru</a>, working in the Applied Power Architecture, where we work on analyzing and
enhancing GPU performance w.r.t per watt of consumed power, leveraging applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
My research interests lie in the applications of machine learning, natural language processing, reinforcement and adversarial learning, and multi-modal AI, particularly at
the intersection of Language and Vision.<br>

<br>I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 with a major in Electronics and Elec. Comm. and a minor in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10558"> <i>Training Generative Dialog Models using Reinforcement Learning with Learned Reward Systems</i></a>, supervised by <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/">Dr. Pawan Goyal</a>.<br>

<br>My hobbies include trekking, photography, calisthenics, and a lil bit of cooking. I also love reading scientific blogs related to astronomy and physiology.<br>
