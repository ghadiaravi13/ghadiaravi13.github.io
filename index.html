<br><br>I am a first-year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, focusing on Computer Systems for
AI and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a research assistant with <a href="https://www.poulamidas.com/">Dr. Poulami Das</a>, where I am working on 
improving the inter-token generation latency during LLM inferencing by tuning KV cache size using predictive ML methods.<br>

<br>Prior to this, I worked as an Applied ML Architect at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/">NVIDIA, Bengaluru</a>, working on GPU Architecture optimization, 
where I built ML-powered predictive models to project performance for NVIDIA's future products. I also helped build analytical models to debug inefficient parts
in the current architecture, particularly for NVIDIA's gaming market products (e.g <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/"> DLSS</a>)
I also worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/">H2Lab, University of Washington</a> under <a href="http://prithvirajva.com/">
Prithviraj Ammanabrolu</a>, where I am working on deriving rewards from freeform linguistic feedback to train Large Language Models using RL.<br>

<br>My research interests lie in efficient designs of computer architecture for running massive AI models. To this end, I am interested in using statistical methods, 
Reinforcement Learning and other optimization algorithms to design efficient systems. I am also keenly interested in NLP, particularly Large Language Models, RLHF, and
interactive systems.<br>

<br>I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 with a major in Electronics and Elec. Comm. and a minor in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10558"> <i>Training Generative Dialog Models using Reinforcement Learning with Learned Reward Systems</i></a>, supervised by <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/">Dr. Pawan Goyal</a>.<br>

<br>My hobbies include trekking, calisthenics, cooking (North Indian cuisines), and playing guitar. I also love reading scientific blogs related to astronomy and physiology.<br>
