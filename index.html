<br><br>I am a GPU Power Architect at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/">NVIDIA, Bengaluru</a>, working on Applied Power Architecture, 
where I analyze and enhance GPU performance w.r.t per watt of consumed power, leveraging applied Machine Learning 
and Reinforcement Learning.
I also work as a research assistant at <a href="https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/">H2Lab, University of Washington</a> 
under <a href="http://prithvirajva.com/">Prithviraj Ammanabrolu</a>, where I am working on deriving 
reward from linguistic feedback to train Language Models using RL.
My research interests lie in energy-efficient designs for computer architecture, using statistical methods, 
Reinforcement Learning and other optimization algorithms. I am also keenly interested in NLP, particularly Language Models, RLHF, and
interactive systems.<br>

<br>I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 with a major in Electronics and Elec. Comm. and a minor in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10558"> <i>Training Generative Dialog Models using Reinforcement Learning with Learned Reward Systems</i></a>, supervised by <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/">Dr. Pawan Goyal</a>.<br>

<br>My hobbies include trekking, photography, calisthenics, and a lil bit of cooking. I also love reading scientific blogs related to astronomy and physiology.<br>
